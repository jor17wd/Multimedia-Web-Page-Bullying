  <p1>Ignatius tried to ask his parents for help. There were some children who discriminated he, hit him, insulted him and pretended he is an autistic person, which made him painful and helpless. But when he told his parents, they thought that the kids were joking and Ignatius should be stronger to face that. Ignatius wanted to run away but there were many other things preventing him from doing that and he didn’t know what could he do to stop them?</p1>

  <br>According to the data published by National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in November 2016, in the past 5 years, the number of British teenagers receiving counseling service online for bullying issue increased by 88%. And in 2016, the number of teenagers receiving bullying consulting service has exceeded 4500, but in 2011, the number of relevant consulting service is only 2400. Not just in Britain, “school bullying” has been found to be considerably prevalent in various cultures. What brought by school bullying is the immeasurable damage to children, which may affect child's whole life.</br>

<br>Ignatius is a student at the University of Leicester now. He comes from Bekasi, Indonesia and came to U.K. with his parents when he was 5 years old. Look back at his “painful” experience from primary school, middle school to high school, he said: “I couldn’t concentrate on my study or other things and I am less polite than I was before. I could not help but say those dirty words.” Although the bad experiences have passed now, Ignatius said the damage to him will never be forgotten, “if I meet them again and my social position is higher than them or if I’m more successful than them, I will make them feel even more painful than I was before.”</br>

<br>Actually, in the whole bullying incident experienced by Ignatius, his parents were dealing with this matter improperly.</br>

<br>“My family thought I would be stronger if I faced that by myself,” Ignatius said. His parents never know that he faced many people who wanted to bully him and sometimes he alone faced or fought 4 people, “they thought the other kids were joking with me”.</br>

<br>13% of teens who use social media (12-17) say they have had an experience on a social network that made them feel nervous about going to school the next day. This is more common among younger teens (20%) than older teens (11%). picture by Emily Kidd2012 from Flickr[/caption]</br>

<br>Jackie Howson retired from teaching in 2014. Before that, she was a form tutor at a primary school. she shared her experience and views with us.</br>

<br>Once Jackie looked after a child (fostered) in my form group who came to her in tears because a small group of girls were making fun of her about her period. “They were three very bright and dominant girls who were making a meal of what they saw as normal,” so Jackie took them into her office, spoke to them and asked them who had helped them when they had started their periods? The answer was their mothers. Then the form tutor gently pointed out ‘Who did Samantha have to ask?’ The girls all had good relationships with their mums and when she asked them to imagine what it might be like to be Sam they burst into tears, which for 13- or 14-year-old was a breakthrough.</br>

<br>“I firmly believe that empathy is the key to deal with bullying,” Jackie Howson, the educator said. She believes in educating the communities in schools and developing skills in dealing with situations to support children who are bullied and children who are bullies.</br>

<br>However, bullying is a result of a combination of complex factors and parents and teachers need to help teenagers understand why it happens and how to deal with it when it happens.

Once there was a student hitting another student in the face at school. His parents had recently broken up and his aggression was undoubtedly the result of his teenage hormones and his personal situation. Jackie told him that what he had done was assault. Tt was as far as she was concerned a criminal offence and she told him that if it were to ever happen again, she would call the police. Jackie didn’t offer sympathy or excuse his actions. “I explained why it was wrong. I said that unless he tries to manage his temper, he would find himself in real trouble. I offered Anger management sessions but drew the line in the sand,” Later, the boy’s mother told Jackie that he was in a shock and realized that his anger could have criminal consequences.</br>

<br>Sociologist Jameela Barnes has been studying sociology for nine years. In the recent years, she has been committed to researching “school bullying” and “modern women rights movement”.</br>


<br>She said according to the most recent Sociological studies based on the classical work of older Sociologists, there are three most common reasons why some people bully others, i.e. environment, genes, and psychological issues.

An example of bullies motivated by environment can be those following the footsteps of their peers or friends. They see a certain group they relate to or admire treat another group in a negative way and they may adopt these behaviors.

Moving on to bullies by nature, sociologists have learned that behavioral issues can pass on to the next generation through genes. Therefore, it’s more likely that a child born from parents with aggressive nature can become aggressive as well.

The final reason is the psychological issue. This could be hormonal issues or it could be a sign of chemical imbalances in the bullies’ mental programming. Having an abundance of hormones can make individuals very aggressive at times.

“When a person is being bullied and a third party wants to get involved in, it’s important to address the issue before it gets out of hand,” Jameela Barnes said. An adult who sees a child being harassed by another child can contact the bully’s parents or school. This may not always work realistically because schools and parents can be negligent in controlling bullies at times. If the bully assaults the victim, even if they are both children, a more severe punishment is in order. It happens quite often that the victim’s parents take the bully’s parents to court and file for monetary compensation as well as filing assault charges. This doesn’t always guarantee results from the court, but it is enough to usually scare the parents of the bullies, and the bullies themselves, to shape up.</br>

<br>In addition to this, Jameela reminds us that: “Bullying happened since the beginning of time and will continue to happen in the future. Do not ignore this issue because without bringing attention to it, the bullying may escalate the situation from frustration or confidence that the victim won't respond.” She thinks the best course of action for the bully is to seek therapy.</br>

<br>Bullying among children is not in the hands of the children to fix, but the adults. If teachers and parents can work together and teach children acceptance, compassion and understanding then there may be less bullying. And if that doesn’t work, the victims need to be protected by the adults that are in charge of the kids and the bullies should be properly reprimanded.</br>
